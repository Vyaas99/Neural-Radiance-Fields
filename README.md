Neural Radiance Fields: Fitting Images and Scenes with MLPs and Volumetric Rendering

In this project, we explore the use of neural networks for rendering 2D and 3D scenes. We start by fitting a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) to a 2D image using positional encoding. Then, we move to 3D scenes and use NeRF (Neural Radiance
Fields), a state-of-the-art approach, to represent and render a 3D scene from multiple 2D views. We implement a neural
network with positional encoding and use volumetric rendering to produce novel views of the scene.
